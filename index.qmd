## About Me

I am currently a **Year 2 Applied Computing in FinTech student** at the Singapore Institute of Technology. Before this, I was at Republic Polytechnic, studying Financial Technology. I am passionate about the potential of FinTech to transform the financial industry and am eager to continuously enhance my skills and knowledge in this dynamic field.

In my free time, I enjoy:
- **Reading**
- **Hiking**
- **Volunteering**

Helping others makes me happy because many people helped my family when I was younger. I'm grateful for that and want to do the same for others. Additionally, I also enjoy participating in competitions to strengthen and broaden my skills.

At the end of the day, I aspire to be proud of how far I have come by always working hard to be the best version of myself.
