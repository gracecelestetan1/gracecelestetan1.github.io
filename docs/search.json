    "text": "GenAI has been a huge part of my learning journey, like a mentor who guides me like teaching me the basics and improving my skills along the way, it also breaks down complex topic for me which helps me digest it faster I mostly use the AI, Chatgpt which I find the most reliable. Additionally it also helps me in identifying bugs if I make any. Though it might not be fully understanding of everything as it might not be good in everything like designing or doing a whole application. But it does help me understand better and guide me when I am in need of small tasks which really helps me alot in my studies and the way I do learning now.\n\n\n\nRelated Video\nWatch this video to learn more:"
